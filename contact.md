# The Basics

Whether you're looking for somebody to mix an album, produce a track, or film a live set  -- I'm open to everything! Get in touch and we can discuss your project and whether I'm the right person for the job. And in case it seems that way -- I'm not just into rock and roll! If you're working on your next pop single or a stripped back folk anthem I'm more than interested in hearing some unique material. Don't be afraid to ask!

# Where to find me

I'm most likely to repond quickly by social media -- DM me @chris.seadon.productions!

Or if you'd prefer, I'm happy to take any business queries by email [@cseadon1@gmail.com](mailto:@cseadon1@gmail.com).
