Somebody remind me to update this page with some actual info :)

Producer and mix engineer, I mostly work in the realm of rock and roll: but also enjoy mixing whatever artists throw at me, pop, folk, you name it. This site will eventually contain some examples of my work.

Also sometimes a videographer? I record live music events and try to make you look better than you are. Again, there will be some examples here at some point in the distant future!
