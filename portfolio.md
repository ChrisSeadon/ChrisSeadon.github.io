A small side project I did in 2021, self producing a few comedy songs about aliens and the takeover of planet earth. The one released song, "My Little (Human) Pal" was about an alien desperately trying to blend in as a human and singing 'regular human music'. It can be found on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/0DqWE2PXTFwjWPHqfH8aV6?si=a7bf75ccbbc341d3).
