Want to hear my production? In addition to anything already featured on the blog, here are some mixes I've worked on for various projects that never got released. Let me know what you think and whether you'd like to see them resurrected!

# Videography

I recently helped out my good friend and fellow producer Shannon James with 'The Council Sessions', a live set recorded at the Boileroom venue in Guildford; providing some handheld B roll for the shoot to contrast the very *static* positions of the venue cameras -- go to [her website](https://shannonjamessound.wixsite.com/my-site/the-council-sessions) to find out more and be notified when it releases!

# The Antibody


A small side project I did in 2021, self producing a few comedy songs about aliens and the takeover of planet earth. The one released song, "My Little (Human) Pal" was about an alien desperately trying to blend in as a human and singing 'regular human music'. It can be found on Spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/0DqWE2PXTFwjWPHqfH8aV6?si=a7bf75ccbbc341d3).
