I'm a producer and mix engineer based in Guildford, UK; mostly focus on rock and roll/punk music but have had a lot of fun mixing more varied genres for people in the past.

I have around three years of both mixing recorded music and doing live sound engineering under my belt, and have really grown to appreciate the stress and pressure of running around a building 5 minutes before the show because somebody's radio mic isn't switched on. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but I'd much rather be on my toes fixing things than with my feet up waiting for something to inevitably break - cup of tea in hand.

I've also done some work as a videographer recently, as filming and editing video has always been a hobby of mine; go to the portfolio page above for some examples of my work or head over to [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8qw29FpAwYhx0V4io-EhZA) and subscribe for future video content.

If you vaguely like the sound of that -- get in touch! I'm always looking for new projects to take on and for new music.


Oh -- I'm also in a band! **ALIEN PEOPLE** recently played their first show, with me serving as a joint-lead vocalist and lead guitar player. Follow us at [@alienpeopleofficial](https://instagram.com/alienpeopleofficial)!
